# Python Sample Without Pants

Inspired by <https://github.com/semaphoreci-demos/semaphore-demo-python-pants>.

## Notes

- Run the programs from the `0_sample_without_pants` directory using **`./test.sh`** (you may need to run **`chmod +x ./test.sh`** first).
- Look at `test.sh` and notice that to run the programs in the directory you
  must use the *module* flag `-m`. For example: **`python3 -m main.main`**
