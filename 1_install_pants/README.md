# Step 1

- Make a copy of the directory `0_sample_without_pants` and `cd` into it.

- Install Pants using the `curl` command described here:
  <https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/installation>

- Here's the command: \
`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://static.pantsbuild.org/setup/one_step_setup.sh)" `

- The result should look like this current directory. Note the files `pants` and
  `pants.toml`.
