# Sample Configured for Pants

## Notes

- You *must* have a `pants.toml` file before you run `./pants tailor`.
  This is installed by the `curl` command given here:
  <https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/installation>

- You must use `::` with `tailor`, e.g.: `./pants tailor ::`. This configures
  everything (creates the `BUILD` files).
